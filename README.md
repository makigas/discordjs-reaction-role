# discordjs-reaction-role

This is a pluggable package for Discord.js applications and bots. It will add or
remove a member from a specific role whenever the user reacts or unreacts to a
specific message using a specific reaction.

Example use cases:

- If a member reacts with 🔔 to a message, the member opts in to the
  Announcements role to be notified of updates.
- If a member reacts with ✅ to a message, the member gets verified as human.
- Use different roles to have different clans or groups in your server.
- Have different roles such as "Likes Cats", "Likes Dogs", "Likes Ducks" and let
  a member add to as many roles as desired to indicate their preferences.

## Requirements

A JavaScript project already depending on Discord.js 13 or Discord.js 14.

**Still using Discord.js 12 and having a hard time upgrading?** 👉 Stay using
discordjs-reaction-role 1.0.2, the last version supporting Discord.js 12. You
can pin it in your package.json like this:

    "discordjs-reaction-role": "<2.0.0"

Sorry for stating this, but consider upgrading your bot.

## How to use

**NOTE**: If you want a more detailed example, check the examples/ directory.
This is useful to see the partials and intents required to run the bot too,
which are:

- Partials: MESSAGE and REACTION.
- Intents: GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS, GUILD_MESSAGES and GUILDS.

Import the ReactionRole manager to use it.

If you are using Node.js and CommonJS: (You probably are if you don't know):

```js
const { ReactionRole } = require("discordjs-reaction-role");
```

If you are using ES Modules or TypeScript, you can make use of import:

```js
import { ReactionRole } from "discordjs-reaction-role";
```

### ReactionRole manager

This library exposes a class called **ReactionRole** that depends on Discord.js'
`Client` class. It tries to be agnostic from any other framework built on top of
Discord.js. This way, it should be easy to integrate into your existing bot
system.

The constructor expects to be given the Discord.js client and the configuration
object. (More on that later.) For instance,

```js
const client = new Client(...);
const rr = new ReactionRole(client, [
  { messageId: "12341234", reaction: "🔔", roleId: "5959859595" }, // Basic usage
  { messageId: "12341234", reaction: "✅", roleId: "5959859598" }, // Multiple reactions per message!
  { messageId: "12341234", reaction: "784536908345", roleId: "5959859598" }, // Custom emoji by ID
  { messageId: "12341234", reaction: "worry", roleId: "5959859598" }, // Custom emoji by emoji name
]);
```

**As soon as you instantiate the ReactionRole class, `messageReactionAdd` and
`messageReactionRemove` events will be caught** and:

- When a member reacts using the given emoji to the given message, the member
  will be added to the role.
- When a member unreacts using the given emoji to the given message, the member
  will be removed from the role.

### Configuration array

The **configuration object** is an array of entries. Each entry has three keys:

- `messageId`: the ID of the message that the user has to react to.
- `reaction`: the emoji that the user has to use, either as the custom emoji ID,
  the custom emoji name or the Unicode codepoint.
- `roleId`: the ID of the role that will be given to the user when reacted.

For instance, if you want that whenever a user reacts with a `:+1:` to the
message with ID 100001, they get the role with ID 300003, you should use the
following configuration object:

```js
const config = [
  {
    messageId: "100001",
    roleId: "300003",
    reaction: "👍",
  },
];
```

When the reaction is removed, the role is removed.

**It is up to you how to set up the configuration object**. For instance, in a
small server or in a bot designed to be used with a single server, you might
just hardcode the settings into the source code of your bot, although this is
not recommended. You could use a SettingProvider or read it from database,
download the JSON from the internet, or whatever.

### Teardown

If you need to remove the events (for instance, to restart the settings), you
can call the `teardown` method:

```js
function stop(role) {
  role.teardown();
}
```

## Known issues

It is difficult to sync the roles and reactions in the following cases:

- If the bot is offline when someone reacts, the reaction will not be picked. It
  has to be done manually, or the user should have to un-react and react again.
- If someone leaves the server after reacting, the reaction will remain,
  although for obvious reasons the user will not be part of that role anymore.
